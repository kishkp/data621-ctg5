# Overview 

The data set contains approximately 466 records and 14 variables. Each record has information on crime for various neighborhoods of a major city. Each record has a response variable indicating whether or not the crime rate is above the median crime rate (1) or not (0).

The objective is to build a binary logistic regression model on the training data set to predict whether the neighborhood will be at risk for high crime levels. In addition, we will provide classifications and probabilities for the evaluation data set using the binary logistic regression model. 

#1 Data Exploration Analysis

In section we will explore and gain some insights into the dataset by pursuing the below high level steps and inquiries: \
-Variable identification \
-Variable Relationships \
-Data summary analysis \
-Outliers and Missing Values Identification


##1.1	Variable identification

First let's display and examine the data dictionary or the data columns as shown in table 1

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if (!require("ggplot2",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("ggplot2",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("MASS",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("MASS",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("knitr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("knitr",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("xtable",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("xtable",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("dplyr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("dplyr",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("psych",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("psych",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("stringr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("stringr",dep=TRUE))
#if (!require("car",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("car",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("faraway",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("faraway",dep=TRUE))

library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
library(stringr)
#library(car)
library(faraway)
library(aod)
library(Rcpp)
library(leaps)
library(ISLR)
library(AUC)
library(ROCR)
library(Amelia)

city_crime_train_full <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/HW3/crime-training-data.csv")

variables<- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/HW3/variables2.csv")
kable(variables, caption = "Variable Description") 




city_crime_test <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/HW3/crime-evaluation-data.csv")

#str(city_crime_test)


```

We notice that all variables are numeric except for two variables: 
the response variable "target" which is binary and the  predictor variable "chas" which 
is a dummy binary variable indicating whether the suburb borders the Charles River (1) or not (0).

Based on the original dataset, our predictor input is made of 13 variables. And our response variable is one variable called target. 


##1.2 Variable Relationships \

The variables seem to not have any arithmetic relations.  In other words, there are no symmetricity or transitivity relationships between any two variable in the independent variable set.  
In addition, since this is Logistic Regression, we will be making the below assumptions on the variables:\newline
-The dependent variable need not to be normally distributed \
-Errors need to be independent but not normally distributed. \
- We will be using GLM and GLM does not assume a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. However, it assumes a linear relationship between link function and independent variables in logit model. \
- Also does not use OLS (Ordinary Least Square) for parameter estimation. Instead, it uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) 

##1.3 Data summary analysis \

```{r}

summary(city_crime_train_full)

```


```{r Analysis of missing values,echo=FALSE}
###finding missing values
missings<- sapply(city_crime_train_full,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
kable(missings, caption = "Missing Values")

missmap(city_crime_train_full, main = "Missing values vs observed")

### finding unique values
uniques<- sapply(city_crime_train_full, function(x) length(unique(x)))
kable(uniques, caption = "Unique Values")

### % break up of target variable 

prop.table(table(city_crime_train_full$target))

```

Based on the analysis above it can be seen that there is no missing value in the data set. Also count of unqiue values for each variable is shown above. Also % split of target variable is given above table which shows data is almost evanly split between binary outcome 0 and 1.\


Train data set will be Split into train data(80% of train set) and validation set (20% of train set)to evalute the perforamnce of the models on the validation set. Train subset will be used to build the models.\


```{r split train data to train and validation, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}


smp_size <- floor(0.80 * nrow(city_crime_train_full))

## set the seed to make your partition reproductible
set.seed(123)

train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(city_crime_train_full)), size = smp_size)

city_crime_train<- city_crime_train_full[train_ind, ]
train_test <- city_crime_train_full[-train_ind, ]

```
\

Two data set has been created city_crime_train (80% of train data), and train_test (20% of train data).\

In next step below relationship between the target variable and dependent variables is shown in three charts.





\newpage

##1.2 Data Summary Analysis


In this section, we will create summary data to better understand the initial relationship variables have with our dependent variable using correlation, central tendency, and dispersion As shown in table 2.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ds_stats <- psych::describe(city_crime_train, skew = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
#ds_stats
kable(ds_stats[1:7], caption= "Data Summary")
kable(ds_stats[8:13], caption= "Data Summary (Cont)")

fun1 <- function(a, y) cor(y, a)
x<-city_crime_train[,]
Correlation <- sapply(x, FUN = fun1, y=city_crime_train$target) 

#kable(data.frame(Correlation), caption = "Correlation between target and predictor variable")
```

\newpage

Now we will produce the correlation table between the independent variables and the dependent variable

```{r}
Correlation <- sort(Correlation, decreasing = TRUE)
kable(Correlation, caption = "Variable Correlation")

```


*** Curious It is clear from the table that most of the variables are having storng correlation with the target variable. \


Correlation analysis suggests that there are strong positive and negative between the independent variables and the dependent variable.  For instance, we notice that there is a strong correlation of .73 between the concentration of nitrogen oxides and crime rate being above average.  We will need to perform more investigations about this correlation as it is not obvious the concentration of nitrogen oxides would results in high crime rate; perhaps it impacts the crime rate indirectly by impacting other independent variables that we may or may not have in our data set.  
In addition, we noticed that accessibility to radial highways also has a strong correlation with the crime rate being average average.  Again we will investigate such correlation. 
We also noticed that unit or house age, property tax, and non-retail businesses having a positive impact on the crime rate being above average.

It is also worth noting that that distances to five Boston employment centers, large residential lots, the proportion of blacks by town, median value of owner-occupied homes, and the average number of rooms per dwelling, all have negative correlation to the crime rate being above crime rate average. In other words, the closer people are to the five Boston employment centers, the more likely the crime rate will be below the crime average. 



##1.3	Outliers and Missing Values Identification


In this section univariate analysis is being caarried out and boxplots diagrams are being used to determine the outliers in variables and decide on whether to act on the outliers. Along with boxplot, Histrogram, Sin, Log,Sqrt,nth transformation diagrams are used to evaluate best transformation to handle outliers.\


```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
#create a new data frame with two columns only (variable, value) for all three predictors
mdata <- melt(city_crime_train_full)
# Output the boxplot
p <- ggplot(data = mdata, aes(x=variable, y=value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
p + facet_wrap( ~ variable, scales="free", ncol=3)

```



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

show_charts <- function(x, ...) {
    
    par(mfrow=c(2,3))
    
    xlabel <- unlist(str_split(deparse(substitute(x)), pattern = "\\$"))[2]
    ylabel <- unlist(str_split(deparse(substitute(y)), pattern = "\\$"))[2]
    
    hist(x,main=xlabel)
    boxplot(x,main=xlabel)

    y<-log(x)
    boxplot(y,main='log transform')
    y<-sqrt(x)
    boxplot(y,main='sqrt transform')
    y<-sin(x)
    boxplot(y,main='sin transform')
    y<-(x)^(1/9)
    boxplot(y,main='ninth transform')
   
}

# attach file to R so that only variable can be called

attach(city_crime_train)

```

Analysis of variable zn:proportion of residential land zoned for large lots 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='zn Transformation'}
show_charts(zn)

```
For zn, we can see that there are large number of values with 0. ninth transformation seem better for this variable..(1)

\newpage
***Please note that we have created similar figures to figure 1 above for each remaining variable. 
However, we hid the remaining figures for ease of streamlining the report as they have similar shapes. However, we have drawn the below observations from each remaining figure. \



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(indus)

```

For indus, we can see that there is a spike toward right side of he distribution. Looking at the sqrt transformation it appears that distribution is close to normal and having two peaks after transformation.  
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(nox)

```
\
For nox, there is a long right tail.

\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(rm)


```

\
For rm, there are some outliers as we can see from box plot. This variable will need some transformation to handle the outliers.
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(age)
```

age of the building variable is skewed heavily towards right side. We will need some transformation for this variable and looks sin transformation is best option for this case  
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(dis)

```

For this variable dis, there are some outliers which needs transformation to handle those outliers. log transformation looks best suited for this scenario.
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(rad)


```

For rad variable distribution is not uniform as seen from the chart and will need transformation.

\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(tax)


```

For tax variable is not uniformly distributed but there is no outlier for this variable.
\



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(ptratio)

```

For pratio has right aligned peak but no outliers are there in data set.
\
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(black)

```


\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(lstat)

```
The variable lstat has long right tail and lef skewed

\
\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show ='hide'}

show_charts(medv)

```


#2. Data Preparation 

Now that we have completed the preliminary analysis, we will be cleaning and consolidating data into one dataset for use in analysis and modeling. We will be puring the belwo steps as guidlines: \
- Outliers treatment \
- Missing values treatment \
- Data transformation \



##2.1 Outliers treatment and transformation

For outliers, we will create 2 sets of variables. 

The first set uses the capping method. In this method, we will replace all outliers that lie outside the 1.5 times of IQR limits. We will cap it by replacing those observations less than the lower limit with the value of 5th %ile and those that lie above the upper limit with the value of 95th %ile. 

Accordingly we create the following new variables while retaining the original variables. 

city_crime_train$tax\
city_crime_train$medv\
city_crime_train$lstat\


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# function for removing outliers - http://r-statistics.co/Outlier-Treatment-With-R.html

treat_outliers <- function(x) {
qnt <- quantile(x, probs=c(.25, .75), na.rm = T)
caps <- quantile(x, probs=c(.05, .95), na.rm = T)
H <- 1.5 * IQR(x, na.rm = T)
x[x < (qnt[1] - H)] <- caps[1]
x[x > (qnt[2] + H)] <- caps[2]
 
return(x)
}

city_crime_train_mod<-city_crime_train
train_test_mod<-train_test

city_crime_train_mod$tax_new <- treat_outliers(city_crime_train$tax)
city_crime_train_mod$medv_new <- treat_outliers(city_crime_train$medv)
city_crime_train_mod$lstat_new <- treat_outliers(city_crime_train$lstat)


train_test_mod$tax_new <- treat_outliers(train_test$tax)
train_test_mod$medv_new <- treat_outliers(train_test$medv)
train_test_mod$lstat_new <- treat_outliers(train_test$lstat)

```


Below boxplots shows distribution of variables after outliers treatment.\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,3))

boxplot(city_crime_train_mod$tax_new,main="tax_new")
boxplot(city_crime_train_mod$medv_new,main="medv_new")
boxplot(city_crime_train_mod$lstat_new,main="lstat_new")

```


In the second set, we will use the sin transformation and create the following variables:

city_crime_train_mod$rm_new\

city_crime_train_mod$dis_new\


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

city_crime_train_mod$rm_new<-sin(city_crime_train$rm)

city_crime_train_mod$dis_new<-sin(city_crime_train$dis)

train_test_mod$rm_new<-sin(train_test$rm)

train_test_mod$dis_new<-sin(train_test$dis)

```


Below is the boxplot after sin transformation of above variable.\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

boxplot(city_crime_train_mod$rm_new,main="rm_new")
boxplot(city_crime_train_mod$dis_new,main="dis_new")

```
\

Additional transformation was performed on following variables\
1. using bucket for zn, with set of values 0 and 1\
2. Converting chas to a factor variale of 0 and 1\
3. Converting target to a factor variale of 0 and 1\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

city_crime_train_mod$zn_new<-city_crime_train_mod$zn

city_crime_train_mod$zn_new [city_crime_train_mod$zn_new > 0] <- 1
city_crime_train_mod$zn_new [city_crime_train_mod$zn_new== 0] <- 0
#city_crime_train_mod$zn_new<-factor(city_crime_train_mod$zn_new)



train_test_mod$zn_new<-train_test$zn

train_test_mod$zn_new [train_test_mod$zn_new > 0] <- 1
train_test_mod$zn_new [train_test_mod$zn_new== 0] <- 0
#city_crime_train_mod$zn_new<-factor(train_test_mod$zn_new)

city_crime_train_mod$chas <-factor(city_crime_train_mod$chas)
train_test_mod$chas <-factor(train_test_mod$chas)
#city_crime_train$target<-factor(city_crime_train$target)

#city_crime_train_mod$chas <-factor(city_crime_train_mod$chas)

#city_crime_train_mod$target<-factor(city_crime_train_mod$target)



```


below we evaluate correlation of target with new variables\

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


#Correlation <- cor(city_crime_train$rm_new,(as.numeric(city_crime_train$target)))

#Correlation <- cor(city_crime_train$dis_new,(as.numeric(city_crime_train$target)))



```

\
All new variables seem to have a positive correlation with target. However, some of them do not seem to have a strong correlation. Lets see how they perform while modeling.


\newpage


#3 Build Models


Below is a summary table showing models and their respective variables. \

 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#modelvars <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/HW1/ModelVars.csv")
#kable(modelvars)

```

*****For every variable the  the model model 

```{r}
x = city_crime_train_full
plot(x$dis,x$target,xlab="distances to five Boston employment centers ",ylab="Probability of crime below average") 
g=glm(target~dis,family=binomial,x) # run a logistic regression model (in this case, generalized linear model with logit link). 
curve(predict(g,data.frame(dis=x),type="resp"),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
points(x$dis,fitted(g),pch=20) 


x = city_crime_train_full
plot(x$nox,x$target,xlab="nitrogen oxides concentration",ylab="Probability of crime below average") #

curve(predict(g,data.frame(nox=x),type="resp"),add=TRUE) # draws a curve based on prediction from logistic regression model
points(x$nox,fitted(g),pch=20) 


library(popbio)
logi.hist.plot(x$nox,x$target,boxp=FALSE,type="hist",col="gray")

library(popbio)
logi.hist.plot(x$dis, x$target,boxp=FALSE,type="hist",col="gray")

```




##3.1.1 Model One by using all given variables

In this model, we will be using all the given variables in train data set.  We will create model using logic function and we will highlight the summary of the model. \
 


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

model1 <- glm(target ~ .-tax, data = city_crime_train, family = "binomial")

summary(model1)

```

##### Interpretation for model 1


(i) Based on the outcome it can be seen that indus,chas,rm,age,black and lstat are not statistically significant. 

(ii)As for the statistically significant variables, nox has the lowest p-value suggesting a strong association of the nox of the target varible. other important varibles are dis,rad,tax,ptratio,medv. AIC value for the model1 =168.71.

(iii) The logistic regression coefficients give the change in the log odds of the outcome for a one unit increase in the predictor variables.

  a. For every one unit change in nox, the log odds of crime rate above median value incremases by 53.41.\
  b. For a one unit increase in dis, the log odds of crime rate above median value incremases by 0.80.\
  c. For a one unit increase in rad, the log odds of crime rate above median value incremases by 0.72.\

```

#####  Interpretation for model 6


#4 Model Selection 

In section we will further examine all six models.  We will apply a model selection strategy defined below to compare the models.
\


##4.1 Model selection strategy:

Following model selection strategy has been used for this assignment: 

(i) Compare accuracy of the models & confusion matrix
(ii) Compare Precision,Sensitivity,Specificity,F1 score
(iii) Compare AUC curve for the models


Following function Eval() will be used to calculate various metrics related to the model like Accuracy, Sensitivity, Precision , Specificity and F1 score
```{r function to calculate model performance,echo=FALSE }
Eval<-function(x){
 TP<-x$Freq[x$metrics=="TRUE_1"]
 FP<-x$Freq[x$metrics=="FALSE_1"]
 TN<-x$Freq[x$metrics=="FALSE_0"]
 FN<-x$Freq[x$metrics=="TRUE_0"]
 Accuracy <-(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
  Error_Rate<-(FP+FN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
  Precision<-TP/(TP+FP)
  sensitivity<-TP/(TP+FN)
  specificity<-TN/(TN+FP)
  F1_Score=2*Precision*sensitivity/(sensitivity+specificity)
 eval_result<-data.frame(Accuracy=c(0),Error_Rate=c(0),Precision=c(0),sensitivity=c(0),specificity=c(0),F1_Score=c(0))
 
 eval_result[1,1]<-Accuracy
 eval_result[1,2]<-Error_Rate
 eval_result[1,3]<- Precision
 eval_result[1,4]<-sensitivity
 eval_result[1,5]<-specificity
 eval_result[1,6]<-F1_Score
 
 eval_result

 }

```


##4.1.1 Model1 Evaluation

```{r model 1 performance,echo=FALSE}

#confusion matrix
pre_train1 <- predict(model1, newdata=train_test, type="response")
df_pre_train1<-as.data.frame(table(pre_train1>0.5,train_test$target))

##4.2 Final Model Seletion

Following is the comparison of various metrics for above 6 models

```{r final model selection, echo=FALSE}

model_comparison

```

From the comparison table it can be concluded model 1 is the best model with very high accuracy rate of 90.42%. Further analysis has been carried out on this model below-\

(i) Estimate confidence interval for coefficient
(ii) odds ratios and 95% CI
(iii) AUC curve
 (iv) Distribution of prediction
 
 
## Estimate confidence interval for coefficient
```{r best model analysis 1,echo=FALSE}

confint.default(model1)

```
\
\
```{r best model analysis 2,echo=FALSE}

exp(cbind(OR = coef(model1), confint.default(model1)))
```

odds ratios and 95% CI

## AUC curve for the selected model
```{r best model analysis 3,echo=FALSE}
#AUC
pred <- prediction(pre_train1, train_test$target)
perf <- performance(pred, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")

auc <- performance(pred, measure = "auc")
auc <- auc@y.values[[1]]

roc.data <- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf@x.values),
                       tpr=unlist(perf@y.values),
                       model="GLM")
ggplot(roc.data, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) +
    geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2) +
    geom_line(aes(y=tpr)) +
    ggtitle(paste0("ROC Curve w/ AUC=", auc))

```

# Distribution of the Predictions

```{r distribution of prediction, echo=FALSE}
plot_pred_type_distribution <- function(df, threshold) {
  v <- rep(NA, nrow(df))
  v <- ifelse(df$pre_train1 >= threshold & df$target == 1, "TP", v)
  v <- ifelse(df$pre_train1 >= threshold & df$target == 0, "FP", v)
  v <- ifelse(df$pre_train1 < threshold & df$target == 1, "FN", v)
  v <- ifelse(df$pre_train1 < threshold & df$target == 0, "TN", v)
  
  df$pred_type <- v
  
  ggplot(data=df, aes(x=target, y=pre_train1)) + 
    geom_violin(fill=rgb(1,1,1,alpha=0.6), color=NA) + 
    geom_jitter(aes(color=pred_type), alpha=0.6) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=threshold, color="red", alpha=0.6) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "type") +
    labs(title=sprintf("Threshold at %.2f", threshold))
}

train_test$pre_train1 <- predict(model1, newdata=train_test, type="response")

plot_pred_type_distribution (train_test,0.5)
```
\
Cconsidering the target has value 1 (crime above median) and 0 when crime is below median, then the above plot illustrates the tradeoff that to be made upon choosing a reasonable threshold. If treshold is increased the the number of false positive (FP) results is lowered, while the number of false negative (FN) results increases.
