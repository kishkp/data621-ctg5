# 1 Abstract:


# 2 Key words:

# 3 Introduction:

The data set contains approximately 41188 obs. of 21 variables. \

This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
   The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.\
   
The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).

This dependent variable tells whether the client will subscribe a bank term deposit or not. This is a binary variable and as such we will be using a Logistic Regression Model.

# 4 Literature review:






##5.1.2	Variable identification 

First let's display and examine the data dictionary or the data columns as shown in table 1

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if (!require("ggplot2",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("ggplot2",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("MASS",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("MASS",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("knitr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("knitr",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("xtable",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("xtable",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("dplyr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("dplyr",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("psych",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("psych",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("stringr",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("stringr",dep=TRUE))
#if (!require("car",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("car",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("faraway",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("faraway",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("popbio",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("popbio",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("gdata",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("gdata",dep=TRUE))
if (!require("reshape",character.only = TRUE)) (install.packages("reshape",dep=TRUE))

bank_train <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/Final%20Project/bank-additional-full.csv",
           sep = ";",
           header = TRUE)

bank_test <-read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/Final%20Project/bank-additional.csv",sep = ";",header = TRUE)

```

We notice that the variables are numerical, categorical and binary. The response variable y is binary.

Based on the original dataset, our predictor input has 21 variables. And our response variable is 1 variable called y. 

Binomial Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more metric (interval or ratio scale) independent variables.


##5.1.3 Preliminary Data Analysis

##5.1.4 Analysis of Predictor variable 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

variable_analysis<- read.csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/Final%20Project/Variable%20Analysis.csv")
kable(variable_analysis, caption = "Variable Analysis") 

```


##5.1.4 Missing values 

We see that there are no missing values in our dataset as shown in table 2 and graph format.
The unique values are given in the table 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



```

##5.1.5 Proportion of Response Variables 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



```



#5.2	Data Preparation

-Convert Binary to 0 and 1\
-Create dummy variables\
-Data Summary Analysis \
-Correlation of Variables with y\


##5.2.1 Convert Binary yes and no to 0 and 1

Now in order to prepare the data for modeling, we need to update Yes = 1 and No = 0. \

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

bank_train2<-bank_train

#update response variable to binary values of 0 and 1
#levels(bank_train2$y)
levels(bank_train2$y) <- c(0, 1)
bank_train2$y <- as.numeric(levels(bank_train2$y))[bank_train2$y]
#str(bank_train2)

```

##5.2.2 Create dummy variables

Now we need to create dummy variables to find out the relationship between y variables and dependent variables, for all categorical variables.\
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# age is numeric 

#create dummy variables for job values
for(level in unique(bank_train2$job)){

##5.2.3 Data Summary with Dummy variables


##5.2.4 Correlation between Response and Predictor of Variables
Now we will produce the correlation table between the independent variables and the dependent variable



##2.5 Outliers Handling

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



```

##5.2.6 Analysis the link function for given variables \

In this section, we will investigate how our initial data aligns with a typical logistic model plot.

Recall the Logistic Regression is part of a larger class of algorithms known as Generalized Linear Model (glm). The fundamental equation of generalized linear model is:

$g(E(y)) = a+ Bx_1+B_2x_2+ B_3x_3+...$

where, g() is the link function, E(y) is the expectation of target variable and $B_0 + B_1x_1 + B_2x_2+B_3x_3$ is the linear predictor ( $B_0,B_1,B_2, B_3$ to be predicted). The role of link function is to 'link' the expectation of y to linear predictor.

In logistic regression, we are only concerned about the probability of outcome dependent variable ( success or failure). As described above, g() is the link function. This function is established using two things: Probability of Success (p) and Probability of Failure (1-p). p should meet following criteria: It must always be positive (since p >= 0) It must always be less than equals to 1 (since p <= 1).

Now let's investigate how our initial data model aligns with the above criteria. In other words, we will plot regression model plots for each variable and compare it to a typical logistic model plot:


The main objective in the transformations is to achieve linear relationships with the dependent variable (or, really, with its logit).

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


 
```

# Methodology

CRISP-DM Methodology has been used for this assignment .....Need material???? image/process flow

## Business Understanding :

## Data Exploration :

5.1 Data Exploration 

In section we will explore and gain some insights into the dataset by pursuing the below high level steps and inquiries: \
-Variable identification \
-Understanding predictor variables relationship with response variable
-Missing values and Unique Values \

## Data Preparation :


## Modeling:

### Logistics Regression:

Logistic Regression is a probabilistic statistical classification model. It is also used to predict a binary response from a binary predictor.Logistics model doesn't't suffer a lot from severe class imbalance. Logistic Regression creates log odds of the response as a linear function of predictor variables. Many of the categorical predictors in the data set for this project have sparse and unbalanced distributions. Using logistics model with the given set of data would need adjustment of variables to fine tune the model.\



### Classification Tree

Classification Tree is used to predict the outcome of a categorical response variable.The purpose of the analyses via tree-building algorithms is to determine a set of logical conditional split that permit accurate classification of cases and accurate prediction.Effectiveness of classification tree model with binary variable is one of the reason for selection for this analysis study. This model though has problem with over fitting. We will also create RandomForest model to overcome that.' \


### RandomForest Model

Random Forests grows many classification trees for given set of response and predictor variables. Each tree gives a classification, and all the outputs from different trees are "votes" for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest). Over fitting problem with the classification tree can be overcome by this approach with weighted average of more number of trees. This method is good for prediction but a little bit difficult to interpret. Since we are facing the binary category,Random Forest is a good classification method to try.\


## Evaluation

There are number of ways to evaluate the regression and classification models based on the purpose like prediction, classification, variable selection etc. In the given business scenario objective is to classification of the response variable by building a model that can predict likelihood of response from Customer. Following evaluation criteria we have used for model evaluation-\

(1) The Hosmer-Lemeshow test assesses the model calibration and how predicted values tend to match the predicted frequency when split by risk decides. This test will be used for Logistics regression model validation. \

(2) AUC along with Model Accuracy will be used for model evaluation. Accuracy is calculated based on certain threshold where as AUC is overall performance evaluation of model as various points.AUC criteria will be given more weight age for model evaluation in this case. \



# Experimentations:

In this section experimentation will be carried out with the data by formulating three different types of models with three different approaches. Following are the three different approaches that will be used here- 

-Model 1- This model will be created by using logit function of Generalized Logistics Model(GLM). 

-Model 2: This model will be created by using  Classification tree function.  

-Model 3- This model will be created by using classification technique RandomForests model. 


There are two data set given with the business case training and test set. Training set will be used to train the model and the test set will be used to evaluate the model performance.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# update "-" in train set
colnames(bank_train2)[15]<-c("job_blue_collar")
colnames(bank_train2)[20]<-c("job_self_employed")

# remove"-" from variable to avoid any issues in running the model in test
colnames(bank_test2)[12]<-c("job_blue_collar")
colnames(bank_test2)[16]<-c("job_self_employed")

```

### Logistics regression- Model 1:

Logistics regression function GLM has been used to classify the campaign response variable. Basic model generated by using GLM function has been enhanced by making necessary adjustments to non associated predictor variables shown  as "NA" in basic model output. Next the model has been validated by using k=5 fold cross validation press to do necessary adjustment to the model.\


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results="hide"}


bank_train2$y<-as.factor(bank_train2$y)
model1 <- glm(y ~.,family=binomial,data=na.omit(bank_train2))
summary(model1)

#anova(model1, test="Chisq")
model1_update<-glm(y ~.-job_student-marital_unknown-education_tertiary-education_tertiary-default_yes-housing_unknown-loan_yes-loan_unknown-contact_cellular-month_sep-day_of_week_fri-poutcome_success,family=binomial,data=na.omit(bank_train2))


# exp(coef(model1_update))

# Cross validation of model for K=5

library(boot)

t1<-cv.glm(bank_train2, model1_update, K = 10)$call
cv.glm(data = bank_train2, glmfit = model1_update, K = 5)

```


### Interpretation from Logistics Regression model:\

There were total 10 iterations been performed before final selection of variables were made. AIC value from model 1 and model1_update(enhanced) model were same 13776. Hence removing variables from basic model does not help performance wise but reduced complexity with less degrees of freedom.By using k=5 cross validation, ($delta) error value came out to be low 0.06289177.\ 

Table below provide details on significance of the variables and its odd ratio-\

```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


model1_var <-read.table(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/data621-ctg5/master/Final%20Project/Model1_var.csv",
           sep = ",",
           header = TRUE)
kable(model1_var, caption = "Signifcant Variables model 1") 

```


###  Classification Tree- Model 2:

The basic idea of classification tree model is to predict a response variable y for the campaign from
predictor variables. Model does this by growing a binary tree. At each node in the tree, a test is applied to one of the inputs. Depending on the outcome of the test two routes to be followed left or right. Eventually a leaf node is reached where a prediction is made about the binary outcome of campaign response. Model 2 has been rated using the Classification function from ROCR package.Basic model has been optimized using prune function. \ 


```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }

model2 <- rpart(y~., data=na.omit(bank_train2), method = "class")

model2_update <- prune(model2, cp = model2$cptable[which.min(model2$cptable[,"xerror"]),"CP"])

plotcp(model2_update)

#printcp(model2_update) # display the results 

```

### Interpretation of Classification Tree Model :\

Following are the most important variables from this model-duration ,nr.employed ,euribor3m ,emp.var.rate, cons.conf.idx , cons.price.idx.Total 6 leafs(decision points) have been formed from this model.
Complete Classification tree is given below in the diagram- \



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
              
# plot the pruned tree 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(model2_update, uniform=TRUE, main="Pruned Classification Tree for TARGET_FLAG")
text(model2_update, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=.8)


```


### RandomForest- Model 3:

In Random Forests many classification trees are formed to classify campaign response variable y. Each tree creates separate set of  classification, each tree is voted for performance for that classification. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest). One model will be created using this method with tree size 50. Then this model will be evaluated with a model of tree size 100.\ 



```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }

# Random Forest prediction of Kyphosis data

model3 <- randomForest(as.factor(y) ~ .,data=bank_train2,importance=TRUE, ntree=10)
# print(model3) # view results 


model4 <- randomForest(as.factor(y) ~ .,data=bank_train2,importance=TRUE, ntree=100)

#plot model 3

par(mfrow=c(2,4))

#layout(matrix(c(1,2),nrow=1),
#width=c(4,1)) 
par(mar=c(2,4,4,0)) #No margin on the right side
plot(model3, log="y")
par(mar=c(1,3,3,1)) #No margin on the left side
plot(c(0,1),type="n", axes=F, xlab="", ylab="")
legend("top", colnames(model3$err.rate),col=1:3,cex=0.8,fill=1:4)

# plot model 4

#layout(matrix(c(1,2),nrow=1),
#width=c(4,1)) 
par(mar=c(1,4,4,0)) #No margin on the right side
plot(model4, log="y")
par(mar=c(2,3,3,1)) #No margin on the left side
plot(c(0,1),type="n", axes=F, xlab="", ylab="")
legend("top", colnames(model4$err.rate),col=1:3,cex=0.8,fill=1:4)

### Interpretation of RandomForest:\

From the chart above it can be seen that classification error rate to classify negative responses reduces with the increase in number of trees but there is no significant change in error rate for positive response.There is  only slight reduction in error rate for negative responses when tree size is increased to 100 from 50.Number of variables tried at each split are 7 with negative classification rate of 0.03 and positive classification error rate of 0.51.\

Below chart provides importance of various variables used in the model.\

## Results from Regression Model

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

#the McFadden R^2 index can be used to assess the model fit.
#pR2(model1)

# Predict result from the model 1 with probability

bank_test2$TARGET_FLAG1<-predict(model1_update,newdata=na.omit(bank_test2),type='response')



#confusion matrix model 1


df_pre_train1<-as.data.frame(table(bank_test2$TARGET_FLAG1>0.5,bank_test2$y))

df_pre_train1$metrics <- paste(df_pre_train1$Var1,df_pre_train1$Var2, sep = '_') 

model_comparison[1,]<-Eval(df_pre_train1)

# cauculate AUC

results1<-ifelse(bank_test2$TARGET_FLAG1>0.5,1,0)

pr <- prediction(results1, bank_test2$y)

auc1<- performance(pr,"auc")

model_comparison[1,c("AUC")]<-c(auc1@y.values[1])


kable(model_comparison[1,],row.names = TRUE, caption = " Model 1 evaluation KPIs")

```


From above table it can be seen Logistics Regression model has a very high accuracy rate of 91.42% when model was evaluated using the validation data set. Though the AUC value for this model was comparatively lower 0.702 which indicates not good fitment of the model.\


```{r Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
library(ResourceSelection)
m <- model1_update<-glm(y ~.-job_student-marital_unknown-education_tertiary-education_tertiary-default_yes-housing_unknown-loan_yes-loan_unknown-contact_cellular-month_sep-day_of_week_fri-poutcome_success,family=binomial,data=na.omit(bank_test2))
hoslem.test(model1_update$y, fitted(m))
```


By using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests when model was evaluated p value came to be greater than 0.05. With this test if the p value is lower than 0.05 model is rejected and if it's high, then the model passes the test. Regression model passed this test.


## Results from Classification Tree- Model 2


```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE }

bank_test2$TARGET_FLAG2<- predict(model2_update,newdata=bank_test2)[,2]


#confusion matrix model 2

df_pre_train1<-as.data.frame(table(bank_test2$TARGET_FLAG2>0.5,bank_test2$y))



df_pre_train1$metrics <- paste(df_pre_train1$Var1,df_pre_train1$Var2, sep = '_') 

model_comparison[2,]<-Eval(df_pre_train1)

# Calulate AUC

results2 <- predict(model2_update,newdata=bank_test2,type="prob")[,2]

pr <- prediction(results2, bank_test2$y)


auc2<- performance(pr,"auc")

model_comparison[2,c("AUC")]<-c(auc2@y.values[1])

kable(model_comparison[2,],row.names = TRUE, caption = " Model 1 evaluation KPIs")

```

It can be seen from the table above, this model 2 has also very high accuracy rate of 91.81% which is very good.This model has AUC value of 0.865 which seem to be inline with given high accuracy.\


## Results from RandomForest Model


```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

The model created using Randomforest has accuracy of 98.64% which is extraordinary results and give rise to suspicion model is able to separate out the classification based on certain variable. When we looked at the importance of variable "duration " it becomes apparent that this variable is being used in a big way to classify response accurately. It can be seen that this model also shows the similar kind of trend in  classification of data in earlier stages with very stiff line till true positive rate of 0.4 and then sharp increase in false positive rate.

# 5 Discussion and Conclusions:


```{r,echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

model_comparison$Model_No<-c("GLM_model1","CRT_model2","RF_model3")
kable(model_comparison[1:3,c(8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)],row.names = TRUE, caption = "Comparison of 3 Model3")

```

Based on the Accuracy of the model, model 1 and model 2 are very close around 91% accuracy with probability threshold of 0.5. Model 3 has much higher value of 98%.  But Accuracy is not always the key criteria for a model as Accuracy is calculated based on a defined threshold. Based on AUC value model 3 has the best AUC value of 0.9398 which is a very good score. Model 3 stands out among the three models.

For all three models it is found variables "duration" is most important variables by far. This variable has positive impact in campaign outcome. This could be due to the fact that longer the Customer stays on phone more productive conversation is taking place to get the Customer start their term deposit Account.
"euribor3m" is most important variable which denotes inter bank interest rate in Eurozone. Term deposit interest rates are generally interlinked and tends to go up together. This variable has positive impact on response variable. Predictor "nr.employed" denotes number of employees for the bank. This variable also has positive impact on campaign response. More the number of employees more visible the bank is and in turn more customers it gets through the campaign.

Among the negative variables "emp.var.rate" has negative impact on response. As negative rate of this variable indicates issues with economy and lower economic activities. That in turn could impact the savings rate and people tend to use their savings that time.

In conclusion it can be suggested to the bank management that focus should be given in hiring more people, doing more quality phone calls. Also to time the campaign in a stable macroeconomic environment to get better return on investment from this campaign.
